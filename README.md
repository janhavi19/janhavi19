# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Janhavi!

Iâ€™m a Machine Learning Engineer and AI Researcher based in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, with a strong focus on deep learning for sensor data, biosignals, and computer vision systems. I bring expertise in developing robust AI pipelinesâ€”from raw data acquisition to deploymentâ€”for both research and industry applications.

âš¡ Iâ€™m passionate about applying AI to real-world domains like marine robotics, healthcare, and multilingual NLP.

âš¡ I regularly explore topics like domain generalization, generative modeling, and signal processing.

âš¡ Iâ€™m currently working on AI validation systems for marine sonar data and fine-tuning LLMs for domain-specific translation tasks.
