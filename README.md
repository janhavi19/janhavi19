# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Janhavi!

Iâ€™m a Machine Learning Engineer and AI Researcher based in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, with a strong focus on deep learning for sensor data, biosignals, and computer vision systems. I bring expertise in developing robust AI pipelinesâ€”from raw data acquisition to deploymentâ€”for both research and industry applications.

âš¡ Iâ€™m passionate about applying AI to real-world domains like marine robotics, healthcare, and multilingual NLP.

âš¡ I regularly explore topics like domain generalization, generative modeling, and signal processing.

âš¡ Iâ€™m currently working on AI validation systems for marine sonar data and fine-tuning LLMs for domain-specific translation tasks.

###  Lane-Following Robot with LiDAR-Camera Fusion
     Developed an autonomous lane-following robot using a TurtleBot platform, combining sensor fusion and classical image processing.

   - **Integrated LiDAR and camera data** on TurtleBot for accurate perception of the environment.

   - **Implemented lane detection** using image processing techniques for visual guidance.

   - **Utilized LiDAR-based localization** to support real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance.

   -  Combined ROS-based modules for sensor control, motion planning, and control loops.

 
### Domain-Generalization-Experiments
This project evaluates generalization of emotion classification in biosignals across domains using three techniques:

1. **Empirical Risk Minimization**  
   Based on [Vapnik's theory (1998)](https://www.wiley.com/en-fr/Statistical+Learning+Theory-p-9780471030034), minimizing sample-based error while considering distribution \( D(S) \) over domain \( X \).

2. **Multitask Bayesian Network**  
   Modeled complex relationships in biosignal data with uncertainty modeling (inspired by Dissanayake).

3. **Convolutional Neural Network**  
   Feature learning from time-series transformed signals, based on architectures such as those from Ballas et al.


### Feature-extraction-for-timeseries-classification
    Applying machine learning to industrial settings often faces the challenge of limited and irregular sensor data. This project tackles automatic feature extraction for time-series data from real-time accelerometer signals monitoring the   
    comfort-closing of car doors.

   - Explores three approaches:  
      1. Pre-trained models on signal data  
      2. Frequency-time domain analysis  
      3. Image-transformed signal features using CNNs
